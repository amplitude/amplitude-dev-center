This guide walks through getting started with Amplitude Experiment. For the best experience, read the guide in this order. You can use the navigation at the bottom of each page to move to the next section.

1. [Create a flag](./create-a-flag.md), and add a [deployment](../../general/data-model.md#deployments). Flags alone are used for standard feature flagging without user analysis. Experiments are used for feature experimentation on users. Learn more about [flags and experiments](../../general/data-model/#flags-and-experiments).
2. [Fetch variants](./fetch-variants.md) to evaluate a user for a flag.
3. [Track exposure](./track-exposure.md) to find out whether a user viewed the variable experience from your feature flag. Exposure tracking is optional for feature flags which don't require analysis, but it's essential when running experiment.
